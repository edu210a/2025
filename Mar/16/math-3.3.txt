Algebra Tiles:
Just look at the arrangement and write what polynomial they make. Then, figure out the factors.

Factoring Trinomials:
a. For x(2) + 6x + 8, it factors to (x + 2)(x + 4).
b. For x(2) + 5x - 14, itâ€™s (x + 7)(x - 2).
c. For x(2) - 3x - 10, you get (x - 5)(x + 2).

Factoring the Polynomial:
Draw a rectangle to show the dimensions based on the factors you find.

Factoring Binomials with Tiles:
